### Problem Introduction
Now, we would like to find the last digit of a partial sum of Fibonacci numbers: F m + F m+1 + · · · + F n .

### Problem Description
Given two non-negative integers m and n, where m ≤ n, find the last digit of the sum F m + F m+1 +
· · · + F n .
### Input Format.
The input consists of two non-negative integers m and n separated by a space.

### Constraints.
 `0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10 14 .`

### Output Format. 
Output the last digit of F m + F m+1 + · · · + F n .

### Samples

*Input*:
`10 200`
